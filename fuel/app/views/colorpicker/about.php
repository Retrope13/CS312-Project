        <h3>Sam McKay</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sam McKay and I am in the last semester of my senior 
            year here at CSU. While at CSU I have been learning about C, C++, Java, 
            JS, Machine Learning, software development, software testing, and in 
            this class PHP/HTML! I was grateful to be able to stretch my creative 
            capabilities within this project, I hope you like it.</p>
